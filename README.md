# Awesome RK3588 | [![Awesome ‚Üó](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)


## Introduction

[<img src="https://www.rock-chips.com/templets/new_2014_9/images//logo.png" align="right" width="100">](https://www.rock-chips.com/)

RK3588 is the flagship 8K SoC chip released by [Rockchip ‚Üó](https://www.rock-chips.com/a/en/), which adopts ARM architecture and is mainly used for PCs, edge computing devices, personal mobile Internet devices, and other digital multimedia applications. RK3588 integrates four Cortex-A76 cores and four Cortex-A55 cores, as well as a separate NEON coprocessor, supporting 8K video codec and decoding.
